    The hake trawl fishery accounts for around half of the landed value of all 
    South African commercial fisheries and is a major contributor to
    Namibia's gross domestic product. In the 60s and 70s, 
    hake stocks were heavily exploited by numerous foreign fleets. 
    This intensification of the fishing effort led to the collapse of 
    stocks (Butterworth and Rademeyer, 2005).
    ### How Schaefer and Fox model could help us to understand overfishing ?
    - Have a look to the mathematical model
    - Learn more about MSY and its importance to set fishing threshold
